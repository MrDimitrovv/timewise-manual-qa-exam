## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains my final project for the **SoftUni QA Fundamentals course**. The project focuses on the "TimeWise" task management system, involving manual functional testing and API validation.

The exam required creating structured documentation for the system's core features, including user authentication and task lifecycle management.

## 📁 Repository Contents
